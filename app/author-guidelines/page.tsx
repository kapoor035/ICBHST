            The International Conference on Trusted Networks and Intelligent
            Systems (TrustNet 2026) seeks original research contributions across
            various disciplines, provided the work's context is adequately
            articulated. Researchers are encouraged to submit their papers by
            the specified deadline. After this date, no new papers will be
            accepted for submission, although modifications to existing
            submissions will still be possible. This conference aims to bring
            together leading experts to discuss and share innovative ideas and
            advancements in AI and computing applications.

ICAIC 2025 respects Intellectual Property Rights. Plagiarism is defined as the incorrect appropriation of someone else's information, thoughts, or ideas and presenting them as one's own. The conference committee will not tolerate this sort of breach of ethical norms at any cost.

Authors submitting manuscripts acknowledge that their work has not been previously published or accepted for publication in a substantially similar form in any peer-reviewed venue. Any breach of these conditions will result in rejection and notification to the other venue where the submission was made. Submissions should be original and not duplicate prior publications or ongoing submissions.
